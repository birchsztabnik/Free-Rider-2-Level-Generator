# Free Rider 2 Level Generator
Ever run out of levels in Free Rider 2? Just make a new one! This java code generates random levels. Just copy the output into the load level screen. It works by randomly generating a combination of 3 character long alphanumeric strings. No guarantee that you can finish the level though.
